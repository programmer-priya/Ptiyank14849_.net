In this repositry we find out the different ways to find min and max value from the array in C#.
METHOD 1 (Simple Linear Search) 
Initialize values of min and max as minimum and maximum of the first two elements respectively. Starting from 3rd, compare each element with max and min, and change max and min accordingly (i.e., if the element is smaller than min then change min, else if the element is greater than max then change max, else ignore the element)

Method 2 using class as retrn type of method

Method 3 using Array as retrn type of method
